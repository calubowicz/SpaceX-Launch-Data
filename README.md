# SpaceX-Launch-Data
This repository includes multiple notebook and python code files that look into the history of SpaceX launches. Data collection for this project was done through SpaceX API requests and webscraping. The data was cleaned to remove appropriate NULL values. This data was then used to make eventual predictions on the success of future flights.
